        <h2>Pay in installments</h2>
        <p>
          By allowing you to pay the course fee in installments, we provide you
          with a flexible payment plan. As a result, our trainees spread the
          cost of the course over time, making it more affordable and
          manageable. This option also allows people to improve their
          technological knowledge without having to pay a large upfront fee,
          keeping them competitive and up to date with the latest developments
          in their field. For more information, questions, or an installment
          plan, please contact our team.
